# 8-Ball Pool Vision & Projection System

An interactive pool table system combining computer vision and projection mapping to enhance both practice and gameplay visualization.

## Features

### Practice Aim Assistant
- Real-time shot prediction system that helps players improve their accuracy
- Projects visual guides showing precise cue ball strike points
- Displays predicted paths for both cue ball and object ball
- Automatically calibrates projection alignment with the physical table
